pytrader
========
 
Pytrader is meant to be a broker independent framework to backtest and exectute automated trading sytems. It comes with basic indicators and an EMA cross example strategy.

At this moment pytrader is still under construction and only backtesting mode is available. That means thereÂ´s still a lot of work to do and any contribution will be welcome :)
